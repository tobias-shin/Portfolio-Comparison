We make two stock portfolios with one higher-risk and the other lower-risk, measured in terms of their volatility.
The higher-risk portfolio consists of one stock with volatility measured higher than that of TSLA (whose volatility is measured with log daily returns).
The lower-risk portfolio consists of one stock from each economic sector, with weights chosen via suitable constrained optimization.
We then compare the two in terms of their volatility, cumulative returns, and Sharpe ratios using historical data from the last two years.
